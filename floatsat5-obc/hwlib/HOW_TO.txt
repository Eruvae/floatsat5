How to Add library:

 Way One:
 	Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols
 		add include path at "Includes" for GNU C and GNU C++
 		add name of project library at "Libraries" (set order before rodos)
 		add path (to Debug_STM32F4 folder of the library) at "Library paths"

 Way Two:
	Properties ->  C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings
	
		add includes path at "C Compiler" and "C++ Compiler"
	
		add library at "C++ Linker": 
			at "Libraries" add name of project in which the library is order before "rodos"
			at "Libraries Search Path" add path of debug folder of the library
